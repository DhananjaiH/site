### Blog Entry #1: Self-portrait - "Flow"

 I recently started to learn to paint - specifically, with water and graphite. I felt the need to have a more analog creative outlet, outside the boundaries of an electronic screen, with the singular goal of just putting something on paper and focus on just that.

The inspiration for this came from reading the phenomenal manga series by Takehiko Inoue, "Vagabond". Based on the journey of the quintessential warrior and philosopher Miyamoto Musashi, the series takes the reader on his spiritual path to attain "perfection", while providing artwork to showcase the author's own search for that perfection.

"Flow" is a good portrait of my present state of mind. Symbolically, it's one of the first few pieces I have tried to paint - a new journey in and of itself. In another sense, it's a representation of why I joined MFA DT. I wanted to take a step back, look at the larger landscape, attempt to understand my path in life, and try to make the most of it.
