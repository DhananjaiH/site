### Blog Entry #3: Mapping Union Square

I had the pleasure of working with Yichan and Kennis for this activity - to create a unique map of Union Square Park.

As we walked through the park, we observed it being busy as ever, with the added activity of the Farmer's Market at the square. The smell lavender soaps, bright flowers big and small, fresh fruits and vegetables piled high were there for all to experience.

Discussing observations as we took our tour around the park, we tried to look for information that was not very obvious. The types of trees, the size and shape of different leaves. The level of activity and passiveness in various parts of the park. The shape, color, & texture of the tile walkway. Or the patterns on the various manholes throughout the park, which seemed to have unique patterns all over the park.

On reaching the Southeast end of the park, we noticed engraved iron plaques adorning an arch around the park.

A second round around the park revealed that the plaques presented a historical timeline of landmark events leading to the Union Square of today. Hidden in plain sight, they revealed important moments in the Square's history, not to mention its importance in Manhattan's history. We knew right away that this is what we wanted to document for our map.

As a group, we initially tried to map the groundwork around the park in detail, in order to highlight the plaques in context to its surrounding background. Their golden-copper shade must have shown brighter, back when it was last installed in 2002.

After giving some additional thought, I felt that abstracting all the details to leave only the historical installations, would give a better visual effect. This resulted in a timeline plot bent into the shape of the southern-half of the park.

The final map merely shows landmark timestamps of events in the park. On looking at it again, I do wish I could have included some of the contextual events illustrated on the plaques at the park. Perhaps a side project for another time...

### Blog Entry #2: Kara Walker - "Event Horizon"

![Kara Walker - Event Horizon - Part 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhananjaiH/site/gh-pages/images/Kara Walker - Event Horizon.JPG)

#### Initial observations and thoughts
- maybe some reference to Dante's Inferno / an alternate take on the painting 'The Nine Circles of Hell'?
- a single long tunnel / bottomless pit connecting two ends of the earth, going underground connecting to the opposite wall
- intermingled themes of falling and escaping, despair and acceptance
- "deep and dark"
- commentary on slavery - on one end, trying to escape harsh conditions (like war / disease / poverty), on the other, slavery and harsh treatment
- the title "Event Horizon" - I initially thought of it from an outside viewer's perspective - its possible to gaze at it, but not beyond the surface, deep into its inner core.
- through discussion with other groups, another interpretation became more apparent - Just like a Black Hole, the artwork illustrates a community that is bounded by oppression on all sides, always getting pulled in. No matter how hard they try to escape, the characters are drawn back to the center.

The process of coming to that conclusion did indeed take some time.

#### Trying to understand her design process;
- Picking a location - a clearly visible, unescapable installation that covers a large space
- Possible intent of the artwork is to serve as a humbling reminder of a dark past, as one climbs up the stairs.
- Making use of the lighting in the space, it provides a strong contrasting image that is inescapable and unavoidable, a story to spark conversation in people using the space.
- serve as a fitting image to a building that serves as a home to a public program.

### Blog Entry #1: Self-portrait - "Flow"

![My painting - Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhananjaiH/site/gh-pages/images/Flow%20-%20JaiH.JPG)

 I recently started to learn to paint - specifically, with water and graphite. I felt the need to have a more analog creative outlet, outside the boundaries of an electronic screen, with the singular goal of just putting something on paper and focus on just that.

The inspiration for this came from reading the phenomenal manga series by Takehiko Inoue, "Vagabond". Based on the journey of the quintessential warrior and philosopher Miyamoto Musashi, the series takes the reader on his spiritual path to attain "perfection", while providing artwork to showcase the author's own search for that perfection.

"Flow" is a good portrait of my present state of mind. Symbolically, it's one of the first few pieces I have tried to paint - a new journey in and of itself. In another sense, it's a representation of why I joined MFA DT. I wanted to take a step back, look at the larger landscape, attempt to understand my path in life, and try to make the most of it.
