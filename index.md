### Blog Entry #6: Creative Research - Questions
_08/05/2019_

Group activity with Shawn, Franzi, Zhuyuan & Tiffany.

We began with a brief introductions of our backgrounds, our domains of interest, and how we hope to pursue our career goals through the DT program. It was truly exciting to see common themes emerge from our interests, despite having a diverse set of interests.

After looking through a research project that inspired me (Blog #5), I imagined that the researchers at XEROX PARC initiated their project with the following research questions:
-  How can Human-Computer Interaction evolve such that the focus is more on "human" than "computer"?
- How can Personal Computing be designed such that it can avail widespread access to information [technology] (besides engineers and scientists)

After discussing and refining the domain some more with the group, and getting some additional feedback and viewpoints, I was most excited about delving deeper into the following research questions

Resulting research questions:
- In the 28 years since, how has HCI evolved & how did it diverge from the vision of ubiquitous computing as proposed by the Researchers at XEROX PARC?
- Since the beginning of the personal computer, how has Information/Technology been accessible to individuals with disabilities (as well as other socio-economic groups/communities)?
- In the next 10-30 years, how will HCI design evolve to better serve people from different socio-economic groups, and differently-abled communities, so that everyone may enjoy the same level of benefit afforded by computers?

### Blog Entry #5: My inspirational project - The Computer for the 21st Century
_08/02/2019_

For my design inspiration, I chose the foundational work of the Computer Scientists & Researchers at XEROX PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), which guided personal computing to where it is today. Their key work ranged from the mid-1970s into the late 90s.

For the sake of this article, I would like to share the article written by Mark Weiser for the Scientific American in 1991, titled '[The Computer for the 21st Century](https://www.lri.fr/~mbl/Stanford/CS477/papers/Weiser-SciAm.pdf)'. While this does not cover the entirety of their work, it was meant as a proposal for a new vision for the future of personal computing i.e. Ubiquitous Computing. The article summarizes some of their key work that conceptualized technologies that are now commonplace in 2019 (think any common Graphic User Interfaces - windows, icons, menus); as well as smartphones, tablets, laptop computers, large interactive tabletops and whiteboards, that can be used interchangeably between individuals, and could fluidly link with, and work as extensions to other computing devices.

To give this article some context - while still in the nascent years, the sale and use of personal computers was on the rise. Mark Weiser, who was the head of the Computer Science Lab at PARC, recognized early that there were still some barriers to making information [technology] accessible to all, including those that came from non-engineering and scientific backgrounds. Of course, as a Computer Scientist and Researcher, they were speculating on the technological aspects of the future of computing. Nonetheless, they did consider some of the behavioral and user interface aspects of the system as a whole.

Below is an excerpt from the article that stood out to me:

_"The arcane aura that surrounds personal computers is not just a user interface problem... the idea of a 'personal' computer itself is misplaced .. and that the vision of [desktops/laptops] is only a transitional step towards achieving the real potential of Information Technology.
We are trying to conceive a new way of thinking about computers, one that takes into account the human world and allows the computers themselves to vanish into the background. Such a disappearance is a fundamental consequence not of technology, but of human psychology. Whenever people learn something sufficiently well, they cease to be aware of it."_

As for the process of devising this project, I believe it must have kickstarted as a result of researching and observing the sale and use of personal computers around the world, in various different industries. In the late 80s and early 90s, there was a rapid development in engineering capability and manufacturing techniques for making smaller transistors and thinner silicon, all used for building computers.

From their vantage point, they Weiser and could have observed being on the foothills of the upward exponential curve, known as Moore's Law. As a thought experiment, they must have foreseen the new capabilities of using smaller components in computers, thereby affording building smaller, more compact devices, while evaluating the forthcoming technical challenges; hardware, network communication protocols, user interface mechanisms and varying interaction concepts between device types.

### Blog Entry #4: The process of formulating a question (or many)
_08/01/2019_

Below are some notes from today's exercise in formulating questions:

#### Act 1
We noted down some of the fundamental reasons for why we are in DT - why did we choose to come here, where we are creatively in our journey, what do we bring with us, and what we hope to achieve with our time. Further categorizing these notes into common themes resulted in:

![Questions - from my notes on Self-portrait](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhananjaiH/site/gh-pages/images/Questions - from my notes on self portrait.JPG)

- How can _"learning from my environment"_ & _"pursuiing new possibilities"_ in _"New York"_ lead to using _"hard interests + skills"_ in the _"intersection of art, history, science & tech"_?

- How can _"questioning meaning/purpose"_ give _"context"_ to _"data visualization"_?

#### Act 2
Reflecting back to the activity from Day \#3 (observing and mapping Union Square Park). Sherry and I got to do a little show and tell with each other - she showed me how she mapped sightings of Apple Airpods (almost as if they were a unique bird species) on people in the park, while I talked about highlighting the historical monuments within the park.
Despite the two themes being counter-intuitive, we were pleasantly surprised to find some common themes:

![Questions - from overlapping dissimilar maps ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhananjaiH/site/gh-pages/images/Question - from overlapping maps containing 2 datasets.JPG)

- How are landmarks placed so that a majority of the people walkthrough it (while wearing Airpods)?
- How did the acceptance of using (& wearing) modern technology changed with time?
- How the entrances (to the park/subway) are affected by the positioning of the historical plaques (& vice-versa)?

#### Act 3
Another exercise in repurposing the notes from Act 1 (with additional newer ones) in order to create some more random / chaotic questions.

![Questions - from random notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhananjaiH/site/gh-pages/images/Questions - from random nonsense notes.JPG)

- How can questioning things make pasta?
- How can design thinking explain memes?
- How can the MTA chain driver-less cars?
- How can manga analyze global warming?
- How can New York code new possibilities?

### Blog Entry #3: Mapping Union Square
_07/31/2019_

I had the pleasure of working with Yichan and Kennis for this activity - to create a unique map of Union Square Park.

As we walked through the park, we observed it being busy as ever, with the added activity of the Farmer's Market at the square. The smell of lavender soaps, bright flowers big and small, fresh fruits and vegetables piled high were there for all to experience.

Discussing observations as we took our tour around the park, we tried to look for information that was not very obvious. The types of trees, the size and shape of different leaves. The level of activity and passiveness in various parts of the park. The shape, color, & texture of the tile walkway. Or the patterns on the various manholes throughout the park, which seemed to have unique patterns all over the park.

On reaching the Southeast end of the park, we noticed an engraved iron plaques adorning an arch around the park.

![Plaque commemorating the George Washington Statue at Union Square Park](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhananjaiH/site/gh-pages/images/USPPlaque-GWStatue.JPG)

A second round around the park revealed that the plaques presented a historical timeline of landmark events leading to the Union Square of today. Hidden in plain sight, they revealed important moments in the Square's history, not to mention its importance in Manhattan's history. We knew right away that this is what we wanted to document for our map.

As a group, we initially tried to map the groundwork around the park in detail, in order to highlight the plaques in context to its surrounding background. Their golden-copper shade must have shown brighter, back when it was last installed in 2002.

After giving some additional thought, I felt that abstracting all the details to leave only the historical installations, would give a better visual effect. This resulted in a timeline plot bent into the shape of the southern-half of the park.

The final map merely shows landmark timestamps of events in the park. On looking at it again, I do wish I could have included some of the contextual events illustrated on the plaques at the park. Perhaps a side project for another time...

### Blog Entry #2: Kara Walker - "Event Horizon"
_07/30/2019_

![Kara Walker - Event Horizon - Part 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhananjaiH/site/gh-pages/images/Kara Walker - Event Horizon.JPG)

#### Initial observations and thoughts
- maybe some reference to Dante's Inferno / an alternate take on the painting 'The Nine Circles of Hell'?
- a single long tunnel / bottomless pit connecting two ends of the earth, going underground connecting to the opposite wall
- intermingled themes of falling and escaping, despair and acceptance
- "deep and dark"
- commentary on slavery - on one end, trying to escape harsh conditions (like war / disease / poverty), on the other, slavery and harsh treatment
- the title "Event Horizon" - I initially thought of it from an outside viewer's perspective - its possible to gaze at it, but not beyond the surface, deep into its inner core.
- through discussion with other groups, another interpretation became more apparent - Just like a Black Hole, the artwork illustrates a community that is bounded by oppression on all sides, always getting pulled in. No matter how hard they try to escape, the characters are drawn back to the center.

The process of coming to that conclusion did indeed take some time.

#### Trying to understand her design process;
- Picking a location - a clearly visible, unescapable installation that covers a large space
- Possible intent of the artwork is to serve as a humbling reminder of a dark past, as one climbs up the stairs.
- Making use of the lighting in the space, it provides a strong contrasting image that is inescapable and unavoidable, a story to spark conversation in people using the space.
- serve as a fitting image to a building that serves as a home to a public program.

### Blog Entry #1: Self-portrait - "Flow"
_07/29/2019_

![Original  Photo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhananjaiH/site/gh-pages/images/47e21fc6-e471-48f4-8e59-43cdfc43f374.jpg)

![My painting - Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhananjaiH/site/gh-pages/images/Flow%20-%20JaiH.JPG)

 I recently started to learn to paint - specifically, with water and graphite. I felt the need to have a more analog creative outlet, outside the boundaries of an electronic screen, with the singular goal of just putting something on paper and focus on just that.

The inspiration for this came from reading the phenomenal manga series by Takehiko Inoue, "Vagabond". Based on the journey of the quintessential warrior and philosopher Miyamoto Musashi, the series takes the reader on his spiritual path to attain "perfection", while providing artwork to showcase the author's own search for that perfection.

"Flow" is a good portrait of my present state of mind. Symbolically, it's one of the first few pieces I have tried to paint - a new journey in and of itself. In another sense, it's a representation of why I joined MFA DT. I wanted to take a step back, look at the larger landscape, attempt to understand my path in life, and try to make the most of it.
