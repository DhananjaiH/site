The theme of this project is — Data Truth vs Lies, and the role of visualization tools to that effect. In this case study, I attempt to visualize and highlight the health impact of e-cigarette use in the US, with a view to guide regulatory frameworks in this industry. While manufacturers and distributors argue that the number of victims is significantly low, this project aims to emphasize that the severity of the data being presented (quality) outweighs the statistical significance (quantity).
The above maps visualize:
a. The approximate number of e-cigarette products sold in 2016.
b. E-cigarette -related lung injuries reported to the CDC (as of 10/15/2019)
c. Lung injuries in the context of approximate products sold
d. A scaled view of lung injuries and deaths in the US due to the use of e-cigarette products.
