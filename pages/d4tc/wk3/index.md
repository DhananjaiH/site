### Week 3: Disability, Access & Agency
_09/10/2019_

The topics and themes in this week's assignments are of particular interest to me, due to my prior experience of working as a researcher in the field of accessible technologies for individuals that are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. Despite the fact that this week's themes are more concerned with access and representation of the disabled community through various art forms, a lot of my responses and insights may stem from looking at trying to improve day-to-day quality of life and accessibility.

The traditional term **"disability"** tends to refer more to a medical, physiological phenomenon that are outside the control of the afflicted individual. However, that need not be the _only_ understanding of a disability. Disabilities can be _situational_ and _contextual_, and appear or disappear in different environments. A prime example of this are subway commuters in NYC - going through the routine exercise of using the trains to get to work, or return back home. For a passing observer, it is easy to note that most passengers tend to have headphones and earphones plugged in, playing their favorite tunes or podcasts. While this may be an attempt to find a little solace in their busy day and to drown out the noisy trains, they are also situationally disabled, rendering them unable to listen to potentially crucial announcements on the train.

Of course, this is a trivial example, and does not compare in magnitude to those that have to suffer physical or psychological hardships every day. The listed videos illustrate some prime examples of how an environment can drastically make it easier / harder for an impaired person to navigate. When working with people who had hearing impairments, I learned more about social accessibility issues. Group conversations were difficult to navigate without an on-site interpreter, and often times it would be difficult to keep track of who was speaking. Day-to-day interactions with non -ASL speakers was also difficult, having to use a shared mobile phone as an interface to communicate via text.

With that in mind, the best approach for designing inclusive spaces and for representation of people from all communities and abilities, it is important to shift towards more participatory and community-driven design. As described by Simi Linton, even projects designed to keep accessibility or inclusion in focus tend to marginalize other groups by design. So if we really want to design for a wide audience, we as artists and designers must realize that we are merely the observers that bring form to the environment that meets the communitys' needs and use that approach as a guiding path towards a more wholistic design.
