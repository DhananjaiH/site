### Main/Final project Notes & such

initial notes:
- presenting information to guide medical decision making?
- how can visual metaphors be contextualized for more effective illustration in the medical context?
- how is the medium / form of the information display affected by the level of technology available (e.g. paper, smartphones, computers, AR).

What is the research TOPIC + GOAL

Research Question(s):

- how can we design the display (or representation) of (contextual) information such that it informs decision-making?
- ** in some sense - an extension to the old douglas englebart vision of augmenting human intellect - as being the ideal vision behind AI tools - and augmenting human work?
- (an improved question?) how should information be communicated from ML / AI tools to guide human decision-making?
- (alt. direction) how should the design of helathcare / wellness / wearable / personal devices (i.e. Continuous monitoring devices) help facilitate non-dystopian future societies?

Motivations:

Based on my exp. in the medical / healthcare field, I have come across numerous scenarios of HCPs getting overwhelming amount of data, which, while necessary to make a diagnostic decision, may be too tedious to make timely decision, or do not illustrate the whole context.
e.g. technicians at hospitals often have to scroll through hours/days worth of patient physiologic data to detect any abnormal conditions.

Outside of the medical industry, similar applications can be found in every industry where ML / AI is likely to take a prominent role.

Hypothesis:

(my hope: AI is only a tool, not an autonomous solution)
With increasing ubiquitous use of ML, and despite it being pitched as a tool for autonomous decision-making, we require effective ways of representing info aggregated by ML applications in ways that they can guide a human to make well-informed decisions.

Notes:

- modes of info display need no only be visual, can be aural or tactile too, depending on the available interface tech
- data viz need not be static either, can be interactive too

Precedents / References:

Jacques Bertin
  - shares a set of graphic communication rules & data structures
  - pioneering documentation works in data viz

Edward Tufte
  - shares a set of principles to follow when plotting
  - less is more
  - clarity in complexity
  - proportions
  - choosing graphs vs tables
  - dude hates pie charts.
  - "clutter is a failure of design, note an attribute of the information"

Sci Fi interfaces blog - Christopher Noessel
  - focuses on interaction design level of interfaces in various sci fi movies, and guesses how the tech works in those worlds
  - this is interesting because artists in sci fi movies always think on the context and use scenario for the story, rather than the technicalities of the data itself.

** London - Cholera crisis - 1854 - Dr. John Snow - Edward Tufte - good example of data storytelling guiding decision making / problem solving

** Clair Patterson - The most important scientist you've never heard of - 1980s - retaliation against Big Oil for use of Lead & Lead Poisoning - example of manipulating data and data viz for negative outcomes

** probably more examples as the one above with regards to global warming / environment / election campaigning.

<todo - put up some of my rough domain maps here>

Possible Methodologies to approach this:
- speculative design process?

End Goal?
- medical viz?
- fitness / training / consumer tech viz?

Success Criteria?
