Following the theme of my research topic - 'how can data be visualized in a way to inform decision-making?', I attempted to explore this through a case study. Given the recent news of the impact e-cigarette use and other harmful effects, I was wondering if any data on this is available, and if so, could it be used to promote awareness and incentivize better consumer safety in the space.

**Process**

I gathered the following data:
- Average E-cigarette (& related) products sold in the US [1]. This paper aggregated monthly product sales information for 2016, from each state and product category. **The average monthly sales numbers were used to approximate the annual unit sales.** Ideally, I would have wanted to extrapolate the unit product sales for 2018/2019, but did not any reliable metrics for doing so.

- The number of Lung-Injury cases and victims reported to the CDC, that have been confirmed as attributable to e-cigarette usage [2]. The CDC provides frequently updated information on this case, and as of October 15, 2019, confirmed 1479 lung injuries and 33 victims. The organization also provides this information grouped by state.

This prototype was made using Sketch software for Mac, with an svg map of USA sourced from [3].

**Reflection**

Visualizing tabular information as a map proved to be a challenging process. The theme I wanted to promote here was that **'the severity of the issue outweighs the statistical significance'**.

- In map \#3, had I chosen to represent the lung injury cases as a percentage of the number of products sold, most of them would be invisible on this map. Instead, I chose to use defined sizes with respect to the map so that they are presented more evenly.
- The above point may also be considered as a Data Lie per Edward Tufte, since I tried to exaggerate the effects visually.
- The hidden bias here also lies in the fact that a fair number of the victims here are attributed to having used uncontrolled chemicals and substances with the Cigarettes, or were using DIY/modified products, and hence, were unregulated to begin with.
- Felt some restriction in working with a map in a software tool, and felt that it drove me to create some fairly standard charts.
