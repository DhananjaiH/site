### Journal Entry #1: Five Goals
_09/01/2019_

I consider myself to be a generalist - with backgrounds in wearing multiple hats as a researcher / technologist / designer. Throughout my academic and professional career so far, I have been able to take projects from research to concept to prototype phases.

However, in order to make truly great products, I aim to gain more depth across these skill sets, as well as improve significantly in conceptualizing and designing the core. I feel that I lack the skills needed to critique and reiterate 'prototypes' into wholesome products, services or experiences. And I also lack the creative confidence to present my work, follow through with my process and trust my ability.

In that light, below are some of my goals I would to overcome over the course of the next 2 years through the MFA DT program at The New School.

#1 Get better at collaborative work, pitching / presenting, receiving critique and feedback, as well as critiquing my own work.
I do consider myself to have good taste in terms of design, but I don't know how to articulate it, or give form to what I eventually want to create.

#2 Improve in my process of iterating from conceptual prototypes to wholesome products/services/experiences
I would like to achieve this at 2 levels: one is the conceptual level - refining the underlying design question(s) and its relevant solution(s). At the second level, I would like to significantly improve the physical/visual/experiential quality of the medium at the final output.

#3 Practice in understanding and designing for larger, complex-systems. I understand the steps involve for this at a conceptual level, but I find myself unable to start, to break down a complex system to its fundamental roots, and then begin to focus at the foundational levels first before looking at the system as whole.

#4 Expand my horizons - both within the technological landscape, as well as toward the larger picture of the human condition. I would like to study speculative science fiction and technology in the context of our current history in order to understand what the future of technology could look like - where are we going at the moment, and where should we aim to be in the near future?
