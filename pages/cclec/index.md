### Journal Entry #4: Ask, Inventory, Observe
_Building on the intentions from two weeks ago, and the questions from last week, this week’s writing prompt begins developing a foundation of knowledge on which you will develop your Major Studio 1 Final Project. While we may occasionally reference others’ qualitative and quantitative synthesized theories, knowledge processed into words, found in books or papers, will not be our primary source of investigation.
Begin answering your questions using the basic creative research techniques below. Report back on two or three research techniques you used, and what you learned from them.
Inventory: Collect, gather and list and what is already known about your topic (history, politics, culture, ecology)
Observe: Witness this prior knowledge in action and describe, draw, photograph, map, diagram, model, storyboard
Ask: Ask experiencers, experts, and those otherwise engaged with your topic anything and everything. How can their body of knowledge and experience become yours?_

### Journal Entry #3: Defining Creative Intentions
_This week’s prompt focuses on your intentions as a creative practitioner. Using the six broad categories discussed in class, begin to define your own intentions. You may use the provided categories, combine them, or develop your own. Be as detailed as you can, speaking to context, community/audience, and resources.
Commercial: innovation and economic factors?
Empower: empowering others?
Educate: educating others?
Express: expressing your opinions about the topic?
Speculate: imagining futures?
Criticize: criticizing something about your topic?_

My general goals as a creative / designer / technologist is to work & innovate at the intersection of science / technology / art & the humanities.

I am in a state in my career where I am critical of the tech industry and critical of the numerous "inventions and innovations" being spun out of the assembly line, known as Silicon Valley. The innovations are being driven by venture capital and vague business models, rather for and towards humanity and society and more holistic goals. In the budding age of technology as we know it today, from the 60s to the 80s to early 90s, we had this grand vision for the future of technology ('to augment human intellect, they said') and the role it would play in human life and work, and what it could mean for society. While this vision did largely play out as intended, we are now running down the rabbit hole of building technology for the sake of adding technology, with each iteration being ever so more trivial than the last. I largely look up to the early research and works from XEROX PARC, which has been foundational to personal computing & the technological landscape of today.

With that in mind, my intent is to create a body of work in the commercial + speculative future tech realm. At present as well as the forthcoming stages of my career, I would to work with tech and services that aim improve human life (either healthcare), or something that would help people get the most out of limited resources (such as in the plausible immediate future where resources might be scarce). The specific areas I would like to explore immediately would be:

- How can the visualization of data be designed such that it can educate and help us make more informed & effective decisions?
- Designing products and services for equal access (with respective to abilities, social conditions etc.)
- Designing for the aging population, without leaving them technologically behind.
- Designing interfaces and interactions for the myriad of wearable and other ubiquitous technologies that may consume our surroundings.

### Journal Entry #2: Five Questions
_09/09/2019_

_Building on your goals from last prompt, develop a set of questions that will help you achieve those goals. Consider the most basic questions you have about achieving those goals. With the questions in mind, seek action-oriented answers that will help you begin achieving each goal. This doesn’t mean you must carry out that action, but instead, that when the time comes, you know how to proceed._

What kind of collaborator should I aim to be?

How will I know if I am developing good/bad qualities as a team member? How will I know whether my ability to present and critique is improving?

Given that this is my second post-graduate degree, do I have any quantitative measures to track my progress, and focus on my motives for joining this program?

Will I be patient with the process and continue with iterating and prototyping till I achieve a meaningful conclusion?

How will I break out my own routine of picking projects that involve solutions that I have already previously attempted?

Will I eventually overcome my inhibitions of thinking of myself as a designer, and build myself with a robust toolset of design processes?

When the opportunity does arrive, I will probably want to consider these approaches (as a start, and evolve this approach over time):
- To improve my collaborative abilities, I will need to seek working with diverse groups of people, from different backgrounds, cultures and goals.
- Get into the habit of being able to quickly prepare a short pitch / presentation of my work and progress for each of my projects, overcome my natural instinct to wait until later to get feedback and critiques.
- A consequence of the previous statement, identify themes from the feedback process and try to make quick revisions. Through readings and observations of others works, develop an understanding of what a 'wholesome' product or service is.
- Not try to consider a complex system as a whole when designing a product, but instead start with considering the different levels of interaction between the product and the system, before looking toward secondary and tertiary consequences.
- Get into a routine of setting up certain chunks of time for myself, and for each of the projects on hand, and give each one its due time under the sunlight.

### Journal Entry #1: Five Goals
_09/01/2019_

_Prepare a list of three to five goals for your time in the program. For each, provide a brief explanation of why this goal is important to you, and how you plan to pursue it through your courses, side projects, and otherwise during the next two academic years._

I consider myself to be a generalist - with backgrounds in wearing multiple hats as a researcher / technologist / designer. Throughout my academic and professional career so far, I have been able to take projects from research to concept to prototype phases.

However, in order to make truly great products, I aim to gain more depth across these skill sets, as well as improve significantly in conceptualizing and designing the core. I feel that I lack the skills needed to critique and reiterate 'prototypes' into wholesome products, services or experiences. And I also lack the creative confidence to present my work, follow through with my process and trust my ability.

In that light, below are some of my goals I would to overcome over the course of the next 2 years through the MFA DT program at The New School.

#1 Get better at collaborative work, pitching / presenting, receiving critique and feedback, as well as critiquing my own work.
I do consider myself to have good taste in terms of design, but I don't know how to articulate it, or give form to what I eventually want to create.

#2 Improve in my process of iterating from conceptual prototypes to wholesome products/services/experiences
I would like to achieve this at 2 levels: one is the conceptual level - refining the underlying design question(s) and its relevant solution(s). At the second level, I would like to significantly improve the physical/visual/experiential quality of the medium at the final output.

#3 Practice in understanding and designing for larger, complex-systems. I understand the steps involved for this at a conceptual level, but I find myself unable to start, to break down a complex system to its fundamental roots, and then begin to focus at the foundational levels first before looking at the system as whole.

#4 Expand my horizons - both within the technological landscape, as well as trying new avenues of research , exploring new forms or types of projects that I would not normally have the opportunity to attempt. I would like to study speculative science fiction and technology in the context of our current history in order to understand what the future of technology could look like - where are we going at the moment, and where should we aim to be in the near future?

#5 Afford myself the time and space to delve into the creative process, in order to improve the outcome to projects I have taken on.
