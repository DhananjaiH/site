### Journal Entry #2: Five Questions
_09/09/2019_

What kind of collaborator should I aim to be?
How will I know if I am developing good/bad qualities as a team member? How will I know whether my ability to present and critique is improving?
Given that this is my second post-graduate degree, do I have any quantitative measures to track my progress, and focus on my motives for joining this program?
Will I be patient with the process and continue with iterating and prototyping till I achieve a meaningful conclusion?
How will I break out my own routine of picking projects that involve solutions that I have already previously attempted?
Will I eventually overcome my inhibitions of thinking of myself as a designer, and build myself with a robust toolset of design processes?

- To improve my collaborative abilities, I will need to seek working with diverse groups of people, from different backgrounds, cultures and goals.
- Get into the habit of being able to quickly prepare a short pitch / presentation of my work and progress for each of my projects, overcome my natural instinct to wait until later to get feedback and critiques.
- A consequence of the previous statement, identify themes from the feedback process and try to make quick revisions. Through readings and observations of others works, develop an understanding of what a 'wholesome' product or service is.
- Not try to consider a complex system as a whole when designing a product, but instead start with considering the different levels of interaction between the product and the system, before looking toward secondary and tertiary consequences.

### Journal Entry #1: Five Goals
_09/01/2019_

I consider myself to be a generalist - with backgrounds in wearing multiple hats as a researcher / technologist / designer. Throughout my academic and professional career so far, I have been able to take projects from research to concept to prototype phases.

However, in order to make truly great products, I aim to gain more depth across these skill sets, as well as improve significantly in conceptualizing and designing the core. I feel that I lack the skills needed to critique and reiterate 'prototypes' into wholesome products, services or experiences. And I also lack the creative confidence to present my work, follow through with my process and trust my ability.

In that light, below are some of my goals I would to overcome over the course of the next 2 years through the MFA DT program at The New School.

#1 Get better at collaborative work, pitching / presenting, receiving critique and feedback, as well as critiquing my own work.
I do consider myself to have good taste in terms of design, but I don't know how to articulate it, or give form to what I eventually want to create.

#2 Improve in my process of iterating from conceptual prototypes to wholesome products/services/experiences
I would like to achieve this at 2 levels: one is the conceptual level - refining the underlying design question(s) and its relevant solution(s). At the second level, I would like to significantly improve the physical/visual/experiential quality of the medium at the final output.

#3 Practice in understanding and designing for larger, complex-systems. I understand the steps involved for this at a conceptual level, but I find myself unable to start, to break down a complex system to its fundamental roots, and then begin to focus at the foundational levels first before looking at the system as whole.

#4 Expand my horizons - both within the technological landscape, as well as trying new avenues of research , exploring new forms or types of projects that I would not normally have the opportunity to attempt. I would like to study speculative science fiction and technology in the context of our current history in order to understand what the future of technology could look like - where are we going at the moment, and where should we aim to be in the near future?
